# My First Website!

Welcome!

This project entailed creating my first website from scratch using 
Cloud9 as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Here I used 
HTML and CSS to create three distinct web pages with images of various
programming tools and languages which, link to their corresponding
Wikipedia page. 

In the process of creating this website I learned technologies such as
Command Line Interface (CLI), Git and how to deploy my website via GitHub.
